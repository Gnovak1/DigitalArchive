    </div>
        <p>This website was the first project we had to do for the Digital Media II class. I  had to choose an animal, research it, and then code a website for it from scratch. I have never even looked at coding before this, so this whole process was full of brand new experiences.</p>

    </div>
        <p>For this website we had to research a music group or individual and put together a full site with a landing page and multiple other pages. Since I had a grip on how to code now, I decided to be a lot more ambitious with this project. I experimented with hovers, unique layouts, and css grid.</p>

    <div>
    <p>For this design we had to make additional app pages for an app we felt needed more. This one was both a relief and a challenge, as it involved a program that I am more familiar with but also a design that needed to be recreated</p>
